## Source Code for the Course [ST0244 Programming Languages](http://www1.eafit.edu.co/asr/courses/st0244-programming-languages/index.html)

* You can clone this repository by running

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/asr/st0244-pl.git
    ```

* The source code examples are from the book: Kent D. Lee
(2017). [Foundations of Programming
Languages](https://kentdlee.github.io/PL/build/html/index.html). 2nd
ed. Springer.

### Using different versions of Python

You can use the [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv) tool
for managing multiple Python versions in your system.

### The JCoCo virtual machine

* Install the JCoCo virtual machine following the instructions
  [here](https://kentdlee.github.io/JCoCoPages/_build/html/index.html).

* The `.casm` (CoCo assembly) files were generated by running Python
and redirecting the standard output to a file, e.g.

    ```bash
    $ python3.2 file.py 1 > file.casm
    ```

* For running the JCoCo virtual machine use

    ```bash
    $ coco file.casm
    ```

* The `.cpasm` (CoCo post-processed assembly) files were obtained from
JCoCo output when using the `-v` option, e.g.

    ```bash
    $ coco -v file.casm
    ```

### Local compilation options

You can create the `.gitignored` file `mk/config.mk` for defining your
local compilation options. See `Makefile`'s for details. An example of
this file is the following:

```bash
$ cat mk/config.mk
CXX_AUX      := g++-9
CXXFLAGS_AUX := -Wall -Wextra -Werror
```

### Tested with

* C++ files were tested with

    ```bash
    $ g++-9 --version
    g++-9 (Ubuntu 9.3.0-10ubuntu2~16.04) 9.3.0
    ```

* Haskell files were tested with

    ```bash
    $ ghc --version
    The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.10.1
    ```

* Java files were tested with

    ```bash
    $ javac -version
    javac 14

    $ java -version
    openjdk version "14" 2020-03-17
    ```

* Prolog files were tested with

    ```bash
    $ swipl --version
    SWI-Prolog version 8.0.3 for x86_64-linux
    ```

* Python files were tested with

    ```bash
    $ python --version
    Python 3.2.6
    ```
